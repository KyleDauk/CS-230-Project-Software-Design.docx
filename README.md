# CS 230 Module Eight Journal – Portfolio Reflection

## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
In CS 230, I interpreted user needs by analyzing The Gaming Room’s requirement for a cross-platform game design. Creating user stories helped break down these needs into technical requirements, such as ensuring unique team names or supporting multiple players per team. This made it easier to translate business goals into a clear and implementable software design document.

## How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
My approach involves starting with user requirements and refining them into designs and tasks that can be developed iteratively. Agile processes like backlog grooming, sprint reviews, and retrospectives are ones I want to continue using. They provide transparency, flexibility, and a rhythm for continuous improvement while developing programs across multiple platforms.

## What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means collaborating effectively, communicating clearly, and being accountable for deliverables. In CS 230, this meant documenting trade-offs (Linux vs. Windows vs. Mac) and sharing design recommendations clearly. A good team member also respects deadlines, supports others, and ensures the team’s shared goals are always prioritized over individual preferences.
